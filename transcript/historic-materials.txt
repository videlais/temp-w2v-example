made insane by suffering during the many months in russian prison camps in three weeks the german government sent of these men to insane asylums and sanitariums for treatment a few who have spells of violence and during these periods must be kept under guard but the majority present a listless woe begone aspect they look about with dull unseeing eyes or sit quietly weeping unconscious of the fact that they are home again the families and friends of the insane soldiers are allowed to greet them and to give them food and clothes before they are sent away for treatment nearly all the prisoners exhibit the most intense bitterness not only toward russia but toward the german government as well one of them who had lost a leg and an arm and who it was learned had been taken prisoner early in the war and has been confined in many russian prison camps shook his fist at a german flag when he arrived and cursed his country his people and all other countries and people to with germany he shouted that is not my flag and germany is not my fatherland he then turned to the other prisoners and pointed to his wound said this is what germany has done to me this is what a kindly fatherland has permitted why didnt they exchange me because i have only one leg and one arm i lost them fighting for germany and all the thanks ive had for it were the rotten years in a russian prison the

manner in which the voters is being carried out and the dispatch with which they are voting the long ticket is a cause for congratulations there were about five hundred votes recorded this morning at

be congratulated upon the manner in which they voted without any unnecessary noise or excitement or delay it may be difficult to hear from the country precincts tonight but the two city precincts

showed germany beaten fled to holland in their absence they were convicted of treason and some of them are under were sentence to death professor de vreeze is accused as a leading activist in the flemish separation movement considering this a political offense and therefore not extraditable the dutch government would not give him up now at a time when relations between holland and belgium are strained because of commercial treaty complications and the renewed efforts of belgium-flemish activists toward the separatist movement belgium has demanded the extradition of de vreeze this time on grounds which if proved holland might consider while it would not consider a political offense the changes however is only that professor de vreeze used for fuel at his house in ghent some government property such as old boxes old books and some coal were on the premises of the library at ghent it is hinted in holland that this is only a subterfuge to get the professor across the frontier the

comfortable place and hear good or bad news you will want to hear the election returns of course and not only will the men want to hear them but the women as well for they have a voice in the elections today and will have one hereafter and they will be more interested than ever in the returns tonight unless there is a big vote in the west for one candidate or the other that no one knows anything about and that would hold back the result something definite should be heard here by midnight and all those who wish to get the first hand information should be at the princess theater tonight where the american legion and the board of trade have joined forces to get the latest stuff right from the wire regarding the vote in the various states it may be possible that will repeat itself and the result be in doubt until some time wednesday in which event the people here will have to depend upon the daily herald but should there be a landslide the result should be known tonight or at least some time in the early hours of the morning if the anxious ones will remain awake that long at any rate the telegraph companies have guaranteed to keep enough returns coming to give the people all that is possible in the way of information on the early dope from all states the princess theater will be open at seven oclock and the small charge of twenty-five cents will be made to

this was indeed helpful and instructive and elicited questions and answers that gave each woman present a new sense of dignity obligation and responsibility resting upon her as a qualified elector it

being the man not the politician always and supplemented mrs leonardis instructions on the voter at the polls a bit of advice that is well for all to heed was to be quick but sure in preparing ones ballot avoiding loss of time on the clerks part by giving ones name as registered immediately and not wait for the clerk to ask for it for women to leave the polls as soon as one has cast her ballot

sometimes with sliv what do you think of sanford a tennesseeans observations of sanford seminoles beautiful and progressive county seat by lloyd the following article was written by a recent visitor to sanford well that is a pretty direct question and one too which might be answered in a great variety of ways but a modest opinion concerning the question and from one who admires the town may possibly be read with some interest by citizens sanford has a population of about and is indeed beautifully situated near lake monroe nature seems to have done her utmost in creating a fine site for a city of genuine worth and enduring progress every town or city has an individual a type of its own and thus attracts citizens of the same general characteristics to a great extent at least i think this is true the people are observed to be thoughtful kind sympathetic and helpful to one another and as the postum man is wont to say theres a reason this is pre-eminently a city of homes the atmosphere of things imparts to one a restful feeling a thoughtful spirit and all are concerned in the development of the city in speaking of sanford as a city of homes however i do not mean to say that it is not also a place of substantial business interests by no means all the various kinds of business are not only well represented but they also seem to be conducted by men of good ability and those who possess the spirit of genuine progress the places of business are for the most part well arranged neatly kept and managed with a promptness and courtesy towards customers that compare favorably with many cities of much larger size the people are elated in the way the daily herald is co-operating in the upbuilding of sanford and seminole county shoots hotel man then kills himself fort myers nov crawley of labelle shot and slighted wounded i a phillips proprietor of the hotel everett at that place late yesterday afternoon then turned the weapon on himself and blew out his

been working at lakeland returned to labelle saturday and endeavored to get his wife to return to him she is said to have appealed to phillips for protection from crawley the latter then left the hotel returned late that evening and demanding to see his wife phillips ordered him out of the place where upon crawley drew his gun and fired at the hotel man the shooting occurred in the room at the hotel a number of men who heard the shot rushed into the hotel and found crawley standing at the door of the room with phillips inside as they came up crawley turned the pistol against his own head and fired he died almost instantly search of the dead mans clothing revealed a note which indicated the he had intended committing suicide the note referred to the trouble he had had with his wife and directed that which he had in his possession and some other money due him for work with other property which he owned be turned over to his sister defuniak oil find proven to be a hoax janitor there poured half-barrel of furniture polish into the sewer tallahassee nov the state geologist hon herman gunter has recently made an extended trip through oilfields of louisiana texas oklahoma and wyoming inspecting the property of certain companies that have made application before the foreign investment company board composed of the comptroller and the attorney-general for permission to sell stock in this state mr gunter has filed various samples in the office of the comptroller of the oils taken from fields visited in his line of duties he has also taken samples from the supposed discovery of oil at or near defuniak springs this state and has filed in the office of the comptroller a number of samples giving the various stages of the oil found in the sands of the deep and has accounted for the presence of oil in this vicinity floor oil seepage at defuniak the school as defuniak springs known at the palmer college uses certain floor oils and furniture polish as well as certain disinfectant and a liquid soap in its lavatories it was learned conclusively that the janitor of the college recently poured into the sewer about a half-barrel of the above named ingredients investigation proved that the mouth of the sewer was stopped up and that the seepage was discovered several feet above the mouth of the sewer where-upon a trench was dug along the line if the sewer back to the seepage and there a hole in the sewer pipe was discovered the state geologist filed ten samples as an exhibit in the comptrollers office and perhaps the most convincing sample to prove that the presence of oil there is not due to natural causes is the sample of sand taken from the ground a few feet below the surface of the seepage this sand is absolutely dry and has the appearance of never having come in contact with the much coveted fluid one of the samples is a small vial of a well known commercial furniture polish another bottle contains a dark colored disinfectant another contains a mixture of

this community is to a certain extent an exception to the general rule both classes are critical as regards community affairs but one class is constructive in its criticisms while the other is destructive the one sees the weak spots in our municipal life points them out and suggests rational methods for correction and improvement the class sees the faults criticizes the authorities for permitting them to exist but offers no sane suggestion for correction the man who accepts a position of authority in any community must except criticism but he has a right to expect the public to refrain from violent criticism unless it can suggest a method of procedure that would be an improvement over the one he employs the public has a legitimate right to criticism its officials when it feels that criticism is due but it should be certain of the justice of that criticism before it is uttered a constructive critic is an asset to any town but the destructive one is simply a knocker constructive criticism is always welcome to any high minded and well intentioned public official but it is a thorn in the flesh to those who surrender to ulterior motives and forget the duty they owe to their constituents our own officials are constructive in both their intentions and in their methods if you see something that needs correction tell them so they will welcome the information it is team work of this kind that breeds success in the garden of life piety and piety many people have a strenuous object to being termed pious the piety of today does not consist of pulling a long face and a sour grin that form of piety is a thing of the past neither is the man with a beautiful smirk necessarily pious some of the worst scalawags in the world travel around with a saintly smile and endeavor to create a halo of benevolence around their ungodly brows that is the reason so many men object to being termed pious the true piety of today does not welter in the gloom of its own existence instead it radiates the joy of life in a manner which all men know comes from the heart and is not donned for commercial reasons pose as an apostle of piety forget it give us instead the rugged honesty and simple truthfulness of a real man who sincerely endeavors to do a little good in the world in his own humble and unobtrusive way with no plaudits from the multitude and no thought

letter of general public interest and the reply following correspondence is of vital interest to every telephone user present and prospective new orleans la october mr epps brown president bell telephone co atlanta ga dear sir i have read the advertisements of your company but i do not understand why you must raise your rates now when the prices of everything else are falling will you please explain this yours truly atlanta ga october mr new orleans la dear sir your letter of october th asks a very natural question and one which demands a full and frank reply which i am glad to make while the prices of a great many things have apparently been reduced these reductions in prices do not apply to articles used by the telephone company or affect the expenditures necessary in the construction and operation of the telephone service labor more than fifty-five per cent of the total expenditures of the company in rendering service are for wages and salaries less than one-tenth of one per cent of this being for executive and general salaries the wages paid to our employees can not and should not be reduced on the contrary they must be increased in many cases to bring our wage scale on a level with wages paid by unregulated businesses so that we may retain our skilled employees necessary to give you efficient service material and apparatus many items of material and apparatus are involved in the current maintenance of the property entirely apart from the enormous quantities involved in the construction of new property and this represents a large item of expense there has been no reduction nor any indication of reduction in the price of these essential articles in practically all of which the labor freight and hauling cost is by far the largest proportion of the total cost we know that the manufactures of telephone equipment and material have orders booked for two years in advance with a constantly increasing demand and which in turn makes a reduction in price in the near future more improbable freight and passenger costs our annual expense for the transportation of freight and passengers is more than one million dollars no one expects the railroads to reduce their charges under the level of costs in rendering their service rent except in the larger centers our central office and stocks of material are housed in rented buildings and even in the larger centers we rent varying amounts of properties like every one else our rents have been greatly increased with no prospect of any reduction even in pre war days all leases for property occupied by us were renewed only at higher charges than for the previous rental periods hotels the board and lodging bill for our men who must travel in connection with the operation and maintenance of the property costs many thousands of dollars every year and we can see no prospect of the hotels lowering their charges until they do we must pay the present high charges electric power and light street car fare we spend many thousands of dollars every year for these services rendered to employees engaged in the maintenance of the property in the majority of cases the rates charged by these companies have been substantially increased and there is no thought of any reduction the telephone company like all others must pay increased rates paper printing and stationery we consume tons of paper for book keeping correspondence and directory purposes and pay many thousands of dollars of dollars for printing annually this item of expense has increased in percentage more than the others and no one has suggested that any reduction in these in costs is probable coal bill the telephone company purchases coal in large quantities to heat the buildings occupied by its employees in rendering the service we of course must pay whatever price is necessary to secure the coal for this purpose insurance even where the actual rate per one thousand dollars has not been increased we are compelled to carry a larger amount of insurance than in pre-war days in order to protect ourselves in the reproduction of any of the property which may be destroyed by fire and this is reflected in a very large increase in the total insurance bill taxes this expense both federal and state county and city has increased every year we have been in business the increase this year being unusually high there is no probability of this expense being reduced we do not pay any excess profit tax because we have never earned enough to be subject to that tax buildings it is common knowledge that the cost of erecting any kind of building now as well as making alternations and repairs which constantly confront the telephone company and which involve material labor freight and hauling is on an enormous higher plane than ever before insofar as the cost of materials may be reduced will this total cost be reduced the only way we can furnished adequate facilities for your use from year to year is by constructing the buildings in which to house the central office apparatus in the larger centers as well as enlarging existing buildings to serve the increased needs and this work must be carried on from year to year without delay this involves hundreds of thousands of dollars in expense to the company there are of course many other items of expense all of which are now at the highest level in prices none of which show any sign of reduction for fundamental reasons until these necessary costs of operation are materially reduced we can not reduce the costs of furnishing telephone service we have carefully studied and analyzed the advertised reduction on prices and find that they are upon articles of which we make but little if any use applied to the telephone business all known reduction in prices would not reduce the cost of furnishing telephone services one twentieth of one per cent this is many times offset by the increase in wages which in many places we must make during the current year our present operating revenues are practically equaling by our operating expenses if the present let down in general business continues for any appreciable time we will lose a material part of the gross revenue now received which will make a still higher rate necessary if a deficit is avoided we are not asking higher rates for the same service we furnished one two or five years ago but for a much greater service which we now furnish consisting of facilities to add many additional telephones to our system during the past one two and five years this fact should be considered when comparing the increase in rates we ask with the increase in the charges of railroad express and other public utilities for the same quantity of service we hope as every one does that in the relatively near future prices and the costs of operation except labor will be lower but we see no immediate prospects of this result as far the telephone company is concerned the increased rates we are now asking are based in a measure upon this hope if the present level of costs of operation go higher through causes beyond our control the proposed rates will not yield a fair profit it is important to remember that no rate for a public utility is permanent if conditions and prices so change in the future as to make the rates we are now asking yield too high a return and if the telephone company should not reduce the rates voluntarily the public service commission would conditions as they are must be met not as they may or should be the highest and best interest of the public is conserved in having the telephone company in position to supply facilities adequate to the demand for telephones and service and in this way be prepared to render at all times an adequate service no community can expand and grow without adequate telephone service with in turn means adequate plant facilities with inadequate returns upon the bare cost of the physical property already in service the companys credit has disappeared with no credit the company cannot secure the millions of dollars required to provide the additions and extensions to its plant which must be provided if the public demand for telephone is supplied respectfully yours epps brown president page the sanford daily herald tuesday november ready to take auto registration urges auto owners to act at once and to make applications complete tallahassee nov all automobile owners and all notaries public and other officers who make a practice of attesting automobile license applications will be interested in the announcement for the comptrollers office that preparations are under way for the registrations the comptroller is sending out this week a supply of application blanks and these are being distributed over the state to the best possible advantage in order to conserve paper and expenses an initial supply has been sent to every clerk of the circuit court every country tax collector every national bank in the state in several of the cities and in many communities there has been some one or more persons who specialize in handling automobile license applications the comptroller is ready to supply these parties with an adequate supply of automobile license application blanks but wishes to emphasize the fact that paper is still scarce and high and that he wishes to avoid any possible wastage and would therefore appreciate if parties making requests for blanks will estimate their needs carefully and not request more than will be needed mr amos states that the number of applications which have to be returned because of being incomplete or for correction in some particular is less now than formerly but there are still a great many applications which he is compelled to return because they are defective in some particular for example the law requires that no license be issued to a person under sixteen years of age hence the question on the blank is owner over sixteen years yet a great many fall to write yes in the blank a very little thing and yet one that will cause the application to be returned for completion one of the most frequent causes for returning applications is the failure of the applicant to give the model and year of the make of his car or truck in many cases it is absolutely essential to have this data before the comptroller is able to determine what series license to assign the car for example to describe a car simply as an overland touring would be quite insufficient for the reason that overland touring cars have been made in seven or eight different horse-power ratings the same is true in regard to many other makes of automobiles and especially so in the case of trucks the comptroller is very anxious to impress on all those sending in applications early that they indicate clearly whether the registration is for for registrations this year it may be of interest to the public to know that the estimate made early in the year that automobile registration for would likely reach has nearly been fulfilled already the registration numbers have to date gone to this includes some transfers chauffeurs and a few miscellaneous entries for duplicate tags the total registration on all classes will undoubtedly go beyond and after subtracting the registration of chauffeurs transfers and miscellaneous entries there will be left a net of registration of automobiles

kathleen long big strawberry crop this season the largest strawberry crop in several years is predicted for the plant city section this season reports from the growers show an increased acreage and prospects for a better crop than that of former seasons some doubt has been expressed as to whether the refrigerator boxes on hand will accommodate an unusually large crop a shortage of refrigerators will not impede the movement of the crop but will likely tend to lower the returns from berries as buyers do not usually give as much for berries shipped in crates as when shipped in refrigerator boxes it will be remembered that the refrigerator boxes ran short a day or two last season but this was due to negligence of the consignees and carriers in returning the empties promptly so far as can be ascertained no probable increased demand the boxes have been made to meet the scarcity and high prices of material and labor are the reasons assigned the estimated cost of manufacturing these boxes according to the estimates of some authorities has jumped from ten to twelve to eighteen dollars apiece with good service in returning empties however the more optimistic buyers think that the present

that they are home again the families and friends of the insane soldiers are allowed to greet them and to give them food and clothes before they are sent away for treatment nearly all the prisoners

flemish separation movement considering this a political offense and therefore not extraditable the dutch government would not give him up now at a time when relations between holland and belgium are strained because of commercial treaty complications and the renewed efforts of belgium-flemish activists toward the separatist movement belgium has demanded the extradition of de vreeze this time on grounds which if proved holland might consider while it would not consider a political offense the changes however is only that professor de vreeze used for fuel at his house in ghent some government

this is true the people are observed to be thoughtful kind sympathetic and helpful to one another and as the postum man is wont to say theres a reason this is pre-eminently a city of homes the atmosphere of things imparts to one a restful feeling a thoughtful spirit and all are concerned in the development of the city in speaking of sanford as a city of homes however i do not mean to say that it is not also a place of substantial business interests by no means all the various kinds of business are not only well represented but they also seem to be conducted by men of good ability and those who possess the spirit of genuine progress the places of business are for the most part well arranged neatly kept and managed with a promptness and courtesy towards customers that compare favorably with many cities of much larger size the people are elated in the way the daily herald is co-operating in the upbuilding of sanford and seminole county shoots hotel man then kills himself

directed that which he had in his possession and some other money due him for work with other property which he owned be turned over to his sister defuniak oil find proven to be a hoax janitor there poured half-barrel of furniture polish into the sewer tallahassee nov the state geologist hon herman gunter has recently made an extended trip through oilfields of louisiana texas oklahoma and wyoming inspecting the property of certain companies that have made application before the foreign investment company board composed of the comptroller and the attorney-general for permission to sell stock in this state mr gunter has filed various samples in the office of the comptroller of the oils taken from fields visited in his line of duties he has also taken samples from the supposed discovery of oil at or near defuniak springs this state and has filed in the office of the comptroller a number of samples giving the various stages of the oil found in the sands of the deep and has accounted for the presence of oil in this vicinity floor oil seepage at defuniak the school as defuniak springs known at the palmer college uses certain floor oils and furniture polish as well as certain disinfectant and a liquid soap in its lavatories it was learned conclusively that the janitor of the college recently poured into the sewer about a half-barrel of the above named ingredients investigation proved that the mouth of the sewer was stopped up and that the seepage was discovered several feet above the mouth of the sewer where-upon a trench was dug along the line if the sewer back to the seepage and there a hole in the sewer pipe was discovered the state geologist filed ten samples as an exhibit in the comptrollers office and perhaps the most convincing sample to prove that the presence of oil there is not due to natural causes is the sample of sand taken from the ground a few feet below the surface of the seepage this sand is absolutely dry and has the appearance of never having come in contact with the much coveted fluid one of the samples is a small vial of a well known commercial furniture polish another bottle contains a dark colored disinfectant another contains a mixture of other ingredients and the interesting part of the investigation is that all of those substances were taken from the same spot in the ground the foreign investment companies board passes upon all applications of investment companies for the state of stock in this state and in its earnest desire to protect the interest of the people of the state very rigid requirements are enforced there are certain companies in the state that have never made application to sell stock and are carrying advertisements in the papers that no stock is for sale but that they held oil leases that they would be willing to sell or dispose of judging however from the report of the state geologist a person cannot afford to take the risk of losing money and should be very careful before investment in wildcat oil

this community is to a certain extent an exception to the general rule both classes are critical as regards community affairs but one class is constructive in its criticisms while the other is destructive the one sees the weak spots in our municipal life points them out and suggests rational methods for correction and improvement the class sees the faults criticizes the authorities for permitting them to exist but offers no sane suggestion for correction the man who accepts a position of authority in any community must except criticism but he has a right to expect the public to refrain from violent criticism unless it can suggest a method of procedure that would be an improvement over the one he employs the public has a legitimate right to criticism its officials when it feels that criticism is due but it should be certain of the justice of that criticism before it is uttered a constructive critic is an asset to any town but the destructive one is simply a knocker constructive criticism is always welcome to any high minded and well intentioned public official but it is a thorn in the flesh to those who surrender to ulterior motives and forget the duty they owe to their constituents our own officials are constructive in both their intentions and in their methods if you see something that needs correction tell them so they will welcome the information it is team work of this kind that breeds success in the garden of life piety and piety many people have a strenuous object to being termed pious the piety of today does not consist of pulling a long face and a sour grin that form of piety is a thing of the past neither is the man with a beautiful smirk necessarily pious some of the worst scalawags in the world travel around with a saintly smile and endeavor to create a halo of benevolence around their ungodly brows that is the reason so many men object to being termed pious the true piety of today does not welter in the gloom of its own existence instead it radiates the joy of life in a manner which all men know comes from the heart and is not donned for commercial reasons pose as an apostle of piety forget it give us instead the rugged honesty and simple truthfulness of a real man who sincerely endeavors to do a little good in the world in his own humble and unobtrusive way with no plaudits from the multitude and no thought

letter of general public interest and the reply following correspondence is of vital interest to every telephone user present and prospective new orleans la october mr epps brown president bell telephone co atlanta ga dear sir i have read the advertisements of your company but i do not understand why you must raise your rates now when the prices of everything else are falling will you please explain this yours truly atlanta ga october mr new orleans la dear sir your letter of october th asks a very natural question and one which demands a full and frank reply which i am glad to make while the prices of a great many things have apparently been reduced these reductions in prices do not apply to articles used by the telephone company or affect the expenditures necessary in the construction and operation of the telephone service labor more than fifty-five per cent of the total expenditures of the company in rendering service are for wages and salaries less than one-tenth of one per cent of this being for executive and general salaries the wages paid to our employees can not and should not be reduced on the contrary they must be increased in many cases to bring our wage scale on a level with wages paid by unregulated businesses so that we may retain our skilled employees necessary to give you efficient service material and apparatus many items of material and apparatus are involved in the current maintenance of the property entirely apart from the enormous quantities involved in the construction of new property and this represents a large item of expense there has been no reduction nor any indication of reduction in the price of these essential articles in practically all of which the labor freight and hauling cost is by far the largest proportion of the total cost we know that the manufactures of telephone equipment and material have orders booked for two years in advance with a constantly increasing demand and which in turn makes a reduction in price in the near future more improbable freight and passenger costs our annual expense for the transportation of freight and passengers is more than one million dollars no one expects the railroads to reduce their charges under the level of costs in rendering their service rent except in the larger centers our central office and stocks of material are housed in rented buildings and even in the larger centers we rent varying amounts of properties like every one else our rents have been greatly increased with no prospect of any reduction even in pre war days all leases for property occupied by us were renewed only at higher charges than for the previous rental periods hotels the board and lodging bill for our men who must travel in connection with the operation and maintenance of the property costs many thousands of dollars every year and we can see no prospect of the hotels lowering their charges until they do we must pay the present high charges electric power and light street car fare we spend many thousands of dollars every year for these services rendered to employees engaged in the maintenance of the property in the majority of cases the rates charged by these companies have been substantially increased and there is no thought of any reduction the telephone company like all others must pay increased rates paper printing and stationery we consume tons of paper for book keeping correspondence and directory purposes and pay many thousands of dollars of dollars for printing annually this item of expense has increased in percentage more than the others and no one has suggested that any reduction in these in costs is probable coal bill the telephone company purchases coal in large quantities to heat the buildings occupied by its employees in rendering the service we of course must pay whatever price is necessary to secure the coal for this purpose insurance even where the actual rate per one thousand dollars has not been increased we are compelled to carry a larger amount of insurance than in pre-war days in order to protect ourselves in the reproduction of any of the property which may be destroyed by fire and this is reflected in a very large increase in the total insurance bill taxes this expense both federal and state county and city has increased every year we have been in business the increase this year being unusually high there is no probability of this expense being reduced we do not pay any excess profit tax because we have never earned enough to be subject to that tax buildings it is common knowledge that the cost of erecting any kind of building now as well as making alternations and repairs which constantly confront the telephone company and which involve material labor freight and hauling is on an enormous higher plane than ever before insofar as the cost of materials may be reduced will this total cost be reduced the only way we can furnished adequate facilities for your use from year to year is by constructing the buildings in which to house the central office apparatus in the larger centers as well as enlarging existing buildings to serve the increased needs and this work must be carried on from year to year without delay this involves hundreds of thousands of dollars in expense to the company there are of course many other items of expense all of which are now at the highest level in prices none of which show any sign of reduction for fundamental reasons until these necessary costs of operation are materially reduced we can not reduce the costs of furnishing telephone service we have carefully studied and analyzed the advertised reduction on prices and find that they are upon articles of which we make but little if any use applied to the telephone business all known reduction in prices would not reduce the cost of furnishing telephone services one twentieth of one per cent this is many times offset by the increase in wages which in many places we must make during the current year our present operating revenues are practically equaling by our operating expenses if the present let down in general business continues for any appreciable time we will lose a material part of the gross revenue now received which will make a still higher rate necessary if a deficit is avoided we are not asking higher rates for the same service we furnished one two or five years ago but for a much greater service which we now furnish consisting of facilities to add many additional telephones to our system during the past one two and five years this fact should be considered when comparing the increase in rates we ask with the increase in the charges of railroad express and other public utilities for the same quantity of service we hope as every one does that in the relatively near future prices and the costs of operation except labor will be lower but we see no immediate prospects of this result as far the telephone company is concerned the increased rates we are now asking are based in a measure upon this hope if the present level of costs of operation go higher through causes beyond our control the proposed rates will not yield a fair profit it is important to remember that no rate for a public utility is permanent if conditions and prices so change in the future as to make the rates we are now asking yield too high a return and if the telephone company should not reduce the rates voluntarily the public service commission would conditions as they are must be met not as they may or should be the highest and best interest of the public is conserved in having the telephone company in position to supply facilities adequate to the demand for telephones and service and in this way be prepared to render at all times an adequate service no community can expand and grow without adequate telephone service with in turn means adequate plant facilities with inadequate returns upon the bare cost of the physical property already in service the companys credit has disappeared with no credit the company cannot secure the millions of dollars required to provide the additions and extensions to its plant which must be provided if the public demand for telephone is supplied respectfully yours epps brown president page the sanford daily herald tuesday november ready to take auto registration urges auto owners to act at once and to make applications complete tallahassee nov all automobile owners and all notaries public and other officers who make a practice of attesting automobile license applications will be interested in the announcement for the comptrollers office that preparations are under way for the registrations the comptroller is sending out this week a supply of application blanks and these are being distributed over the state to the best possible advantage in order to conserve paper and expenses an initial supply has been sent to every clerk of the circuit court every country tax collector every national bank in the state in several of the cities and in many communities there has been some one or more persons who specialize in handling automobile license applications the comptroller is ready to supply these parties with an adequate supply of automobile license application blanks but wishes to emphasize the fact that paper is still scarce and high and that he wishes to avoid any possible wastage and would therefore appreciate if parties making requests for blanks will estimate their needs carefully and not request more than will be needed mr amos states that the number of applications which have to be returned because of being incomplete or for correction in some particular is less now than formerly but there are still a great many applications which he is compelled to return because they are defective in some particular for example the law requires that no license be issued to a person under sixteen years of age hence the question on the blank is owner over sixteen years yet a great many fall to write yes in the blank a very little thing and yet one that will cause the application to be returned for completion one of the most frequent causes for returning applications is the failure of the applicant to give the model and year of the make of his car or truck in many cases it is absolutely essential to have this data before the comptroller is able to determine what series license to assign the car for example to describe a car simply as an overland touring would be quite insufficient for the reason that overland touring cars have been made in seven or eight different horse-power ratings the same is true in regard to many other makes of automobiles and especially so in the case of trucks the comptroller is very anxious to impress on all those sending in applications early that they indicate clearly whether the registration is for for registrations this year it may be of interest to the public to know that the estimate made early in the year that automobile registration for would likely reach has nearly been fulfilled already the registration numbers have to date gone to this includes some transfers chauffeurs and a few miscellaneous entries for duplicate tags the total registration on all classes will undoubtedly go beyond and after subtracting the registration of chauffeurs transfers and miscellaneous entries there will be left a net of registration of automobiles

kathleen long big strawberry crop this season the largest strawberry crop in several years is predicted for the plant city section this season reports from the growers show an increased acreage and prospects for a better crop than that of former seasons some doubt has been expressed as to whether the refrigerator boxes on hand will accommodate an unusually large crop a shortage of refrigerators will not impede the movement of the crop but will likely tend to lower the returns from berries as buyers do not usually give as much for berries shipped in crates as when shipped in refrigerator boxes it will be remembered that the refrigerator boxes ran short a day or two last season but this was due to negligence of the consignees and carriers in returning the empties promptly so far as can be ascertained no probable increased demand the boxes have been made to meet the scarcity and high prices of material and labor are the reasons assigned the estimated cost of manufacturing these boxes according to the estimates of some authorities has jumped from ten to twelve to eighteen dollars apiece with good service in returning empties however the more optimistic buyers think that the present

made insane by suffering during the many months in russian prison camps in three weeks the german government sent of these men to insane asylums and sanitariums for treatment a few who have spells of violence and during these periods must be kept under guard but the majority present a listless woe begone aspect they look about with dull unseeing eyes or sit quietly weeping unconscious of the fact that they are home again the families and friends of the insane soldiers are allowed to greet them and to give them food and clothes before they are sent away for treatment nearly all the prisoners exhibit the most intense bitterness not only toward russia but toward the german government as well one of them who had lost a leg and an arm and who it was learned had been taken prisoner early in the war and has been confined in many russian prison camps shook his fist at a german flag when he arrived and cursed his country his people and all other countries and people to with germany he shouted that is not my flag and germany is not my fatherland he then turned to the other prisoners and pointed to his wound said this is what germany has done to me this is what a kindly fatherland has permitted why didnt they exchange me because i have only one leg and one arm i lost them fighting for germany and all the thanks ive had for it were the rotten years in a russian prison the

be congratulated upon the manner in which they voted without any unnecessary noise or excitement or delay it may be difficult to hear from the country precincts tonight but the two city precincts

showed germany beaten fled to holland in their absence they were convicted of treason and some of them are under were sentence to death professor de vreeze is accused as a leading activist in the flemish separation movement considering this a political offense and therefore not extraditable the dutch government would not give him up now at a time when relations between holland and belgium are strained because of commercial treaty complications and the renewed efforts of belgium-flemish activists toward the separatist movement belgium has demanded the extradition of de vreeze this time on grounds which if proved holland might consider while it would not consider a political offense the changes however is only that professor de vreeze used for fuel at his house in ghent some government property such as old boxes old books and some coal were on the premises of the library at ghent it is hinted in holland that this is only a subterfuge to get the professor across the frontier the

tonight where the american legion and the board of trade have joined forces to get the latest stuff right from the wire regarding the vote in the various states it may be possible that will repeat

people all that is possible in the way of information on the early dope from all states the princess theater will be open at seven oclock and the small charge of twenty-five cents will be made to

to sanford well that is a pretty direct question and one too which might be answered in a great variety of ways but a modest opinion concerning the question and from one who admires the town may possibly be read with some interest by citizens sanford has a population of about and is indeed beautifully situated near lake monroe nature seems to have done her utmost in creating a fine site for a city of genuine worth and enduring progress every town or city has an individual a type of its own and thus attracts citizens of the same general characteristics to a great extent at least i think this is true the people are observed to be thoughtful kind sympathetic and helpful to one another and as the postum man is wont to say theres a reason this is pre-eminently a city of homes the atmosphere of things imparts to one a restful feeling a thoughtful spirit and all are concerned in the development of the city in speaking of sanford as a city of homes however i do not mean to say that it is not also a place of substantial business interests by no means all the various kinds of business are not only well represented but they also seem to be conducted by men of good ability and those who possess the spirit of genuine progress the places of business are for the most part well arranged neatly kept and managed with a promptness and courtesy towards customers that compare favorably with many cities of much larger size the people are elated in the way the daily herald is co-operating in the upbuilding of sanford and seminole county shoots hotel man then kills himself fort myers nov crawley of labelle shot and slighted wounded i a phillips proprietor of the hotel everett at that place late yesterday afternoon then turned the weapon on himself and blew out his brains phillip wound was not serious a flesh wound in the arm the trouble arose over crawleys wife who had left him and refused to return she was employed as housekeeper at the everett crawley who had been working at lakeland returned to labelle saturday and endeavored to get his wife to return to him she is said to have appealed to phillips for protection from crawley the latter then left the hotel returned late that evening and demanding to see his wife phillips ordered him out of the place where upon crawley drew his gun and fired at the hotel man the shooting occurred in the room at the hotel a number of men who heard the shot rushed into the hotel and found crawley standing at the door of the room with phillips inside as they came up crawley turned the pistol against his own head and fired he died almost instantly search of the dead mans clothing revealed a note which indicated the he had intended committing suicide the note referred to the trouble he had had with his wife and directed that which he had in his possession and some other money due him for work with other property which he owned be turned over to his sister defuniak oil find proven to be a hoax janitor there poured half-barrel of furniture polish into the sewer tallahassee nov the state geologist hon herman gunter has recently made an extended trip through oilfields of louisiana texas oklahoma and wyoming inspecting the property of certain companies that have made application before the foreign investment company board composed of the comptroller and the attorney-general for permission to sell stock in this state mr gunter has filed various samples in the office of the comptroller of the oils taken from fields visited in his line of duties he has also taken samples from the supposed discovery of oil at or near defuniak springs this state and has filed in the office of the comptroller a number of samples giving the various stages of the oil found in the sands of the deep and has accounted for the presence of oil in this vicinity floor oil seepage at defuniak the school as defuniak springs known at the palmer college uses certain floor oils and furniture polish as well as certain disinfectant and a liquid soap in its lavatories it was learned conclusively that the janitor of the college recently poured into the sewer about a half-barrel of the above named ingredients investigation proved that the mouth of the sewer was stopped up and that the seepage was discovered several feet above the mouth of the sewer where-upon a trench was dug along the line if the sewer back to the seepage and there a hole in the sewer pipe was discovered the state geologist filed ten samples as an exhibit in the comptrollers office and perhaps the most convincing sample to prove that the presence of oil there is not due to natural causes is the sample of sand taken from the ground a few feet below the surface of the seepage this sand is absolutely dry and has the appearance of never having come in contact with the much coveted fluid one of the samples is a small vial of a well known commercial furniture polish another bottle contains a dark colored disinfectant another contains a mixture of other ingredients and the interesting part of the investigation is that all of those substances were taken from the same spot in the ground the foreign investment companies board passes upon all applications of investment companies for the state of stock in this state and in its earnest desire to protect the interest of the people of the state very rigid requirements are enforced there are certain companies in the state that have never made application to sell stock and are carrying advertisements in the papers that no stock is for sale but that they held oil leases that they would be willing to sell or dispose of judging however from the report of the state geologist a person cannot afford to take the risk of losing money and should be very careful before investment in wildcat oil

this community is to a certain extent an exception to the general rule both classes are critical as regards community affairs but one class is constructive in its criticisms while the other is destructive the one sees the weak spots in our municipal life points them out and suggests rational methods for correction and improvement the class sees the faults criticizes the authorities for permitting them to exist but offers no sane suggestion for correction the man who accepts a position of authority in any community must except criticism but he has a right to expect the public to refrain from violent criticism unless it can suggest a method of procedure that would be an improvement over the one he employs the public has a legitimate right to criticism its officials when it feels that criticism is due but it should be certain of the justice of that criticism before it is uttered a constructive critic is an asset to any town but the destructive one is simply a knocker constructive criticism is always welcome to any high minded and well intentioned public official but it is a thorn in the flesh to those who surrender to ulterior motives and forget the duty they owe to their constituents our own officials are constructive in both their intentions and in their methods if you see something that needs correction tell them so they will welcome the information it is team work of this kind that breeds success in the garden of life piety and piety many people have a strenuous object to being termed pious the piety of today does not consist of pulling a long face and a sour grin that form of piety is a thing of the past neither is the man with a beautiful smirk necessarily pious some of the worst scalawags in the world travel around with a saintly smile and endeavor to create a halo of benevolence around their ungodly brows that is the reason so many men object to being termed pious the true piety of today does not welter in the gloom of its own existence instead it radiates the joy of life in a manner which all men know comes from the heart and is not donned for commercial reasons pose as an apostle of piety forget it give us instead the

letter of general public interest and the reply following correspondence is of vital interest to every telephone user present and prospective new orleans la october mr epps brown president bell telephone co atlanta ga dear sir i have read the advertisements of your company but i do not understand why you must raise your rates now when the prices of everything else are falling will you please explain this yours truly atlanta ga october mr new orleans la dear sir your letter of october th asks a very natural question and one which demands a full and frank reply which i am glad to make while the prices of a great many things have apparently been reduced these reductions in prices do not apply to articles used by the telephone company or affect the expenditures necessary in the construction and operation of the telephone service labor more than fifty-five per cent of the total expenditures of the company in rendering service are for wages and salaries less than one-tenth of one per cent of this being for executive and general salaries the wages paid to our employees can not and should not be reduced on the contrary they must be increased in many cases to bring our wage scale on a level with wages paid by unregulated businesses so that we may retain our skilled employees necessary to give you efficient service material and apparatus many items of material and apparatus are involved in the current maintenance of the property entirely apart from the enormous quantities involved in the construction of new property and this represents a large item of expense there has been no reduction nor any indication of reduction in the price of these essential articles in practically all of which the labor freight and hauling cost is by far the largest proportion of the total cost we know that the manufactures of telephone equipment and material have orders booked for two years in advance with a constantly increasing demand and which in turn makes a reduction in price in the near future more improbable freight and passenger costs our annual expense for the transportation of freight and passengers is more than one million dollars no one expects the railroads to reduce their charges under the level of costs in rendering their service rent except in the larger centers our central office and stocks of material are housed in rented buildings and even in the larger centers we rent varying amounts of properties like every one else our rents have been greatly increased with no prospect of any reduction even in pre war days all leases for property occupied by us were renewed only at higher charges than for the previous rental periods hotels the board and lodging bill for our men who must travel in connection with the operation and maintenance of the property costs many thousands of dollars every year and we can see no prospect of the hotels lowering their charges until they do we must pay the present high charges electric power and light street car fare we spend many thousands of dollars every year for these services rendered to employees engaged in the maintenance of the property in the majority of cases the rates charged by these companies have been substantially increased and there is no thought of any reduction the telephone company like all others must pay increased rates paper printing and stationery we consume tons of paper for book keeping correspondence and directory purposes and pay many thousands of dollars of dollars for printing annually this item of expense has increased in percentage more than the others and no one has suggested that any reduction in these in costs is probable coal bill the telephone company purchases coal in large quantities to heat the buildings occupied by its employees in rendering the service we of course must pay whatever price is necessary to secure the coal for this purpose insurance even where the actual rate per one thousand dollars has not been increased we are compelled to carry a larger amount of insurance than in pre-war days in order to protect ourselves in the reproduction of any of the property which may be destroyed by fire and this is reflected in a very large increase in the total insurance bill taxes this expense both federal and state county and city has increased every year we have been in business the increase this year being unusually high there is no probability of this expense being reduced we do not pay any excess profit tax because we have never earned enough to be subject to that tax buildings it is common knowledge that the cost of erecting any kind of building now as well as making alternations and repairs which constantly confront the telephone company and which involve material labor freight and hauling is on an enormous higher plane than ever before insofar as the cost of materials may be reduced will this total cost be reduced the only way we can furnished adequate facilities for your use from year to year is by constructing the buildings in which to house the central office apparatus in the larger centers as well as enlarging existing buildings to serve the increased needs and this work must be carried on from year to year without delay this involves hundreds of thousands of dollars in expense to the company there are of course many other items of expense all of which are now at the highest level in prices none of which show any sign of reduction for fundamental reasons until these necessary costs of operation are materially reduced we can not reduce the costs of furnishing telephone service we have carefully studied and analyzed the advertised reduction on prices and find that they are upon articles of which we make but little if any use applied to the telephone business all known reduction in prices would not reduce the cost of furnishing telephone services one twentieth of one per cent this is many times offset by the increase in wages which in many places we must make during the current year our present operating revenues are practically equaling by our operating expenses if the present let down in general business continues for any appreciable time we will lose a material part of the gross revenue now received which will make a still higher rate necessary if a deficit is avoided we are not asking higher rates for the same service we furnished one two or five years ago but for a much greater service which we now furnish consisting of facilities to add many additional telephones to our system during the past one two and five years this fact should be considered when comparing the increase in rates we ask with the increase in the charges of railroad express and other public utilities for the same quantity of service we hope as every one does that in the relatively near future prices and the costs of operation except labor will be lower but we see no immediate prospects of this result as far the telephone company is concerned the increased rates we are now asking are based in a measure upon this hope if the present level of costs of operation go higher through causes beyond our control the proposed rates will not yield a fair profit it is important to remember that no rate for a public utility is permanent if conditions and prices so change in the future as to make the rates we are now asking yield too high a return and if the telephone company should not reduce the rates voluntarily the public service commission would conditions as they are must be met not as they may or should be the highest and best interest of the public is conserved in having the telephone company in position to supply facilities adequate to the demand for telephones and service and in this way be prepared to render at all times an adequate service no community can expand and grow without adequate telephone service with in turn means adequate plant facilities with inadequate returns upon the bare cost of the physical property already in service the companys credit has disappeared with no credit the company cannot secure the millions of dollars required to provide the additions and extensions to its plant which must be provided if the public demand for telephone is supplied respectfully yours epps brown president page the sanford daily herald tuesday november ready to take auto registration urges auto owners to act at once and to make applications complete tallahassee nov all automobile owners and all notaries public and other officers who make a practice of attesting automobile license applications will be interested in the announcement for the comptrollers office that preparations are under way for the registrations the comptroller is sending out this week a supply of application blanks and these are being distributed over the state to the best possible advantage in order to conserve paper and expenses an initial supply has been sent to every clerk of the circuit court every country tax collector every national bank in the state in several of the cities and in many communities there has been some one or more persons who specialize in handling automobile license applications the comptroller is ready to supply these parties with an adequate supply of automobile license application blanks but wishes to emphasize the fact that paper is still scarce and high and that he wishes to avoid any possible wastage and would therefore appreciate if parties making requests for blanks will estimate their needs carefully and not request more than will be needed mr amos states that the number of applications which have to be returned because of being incomplete or for correction in some particular is less now than formerly but there are still a great many applications which he is compelled to return because they are defective in some particular for example the law requires that no license be issued to a person under sixteen years of age hence the question on the blank is owner over sixteen years yet a great many fall to write yes in the blank a very little thing and yet one that will cause the application to be returned for completion one of the most frequent causes for returning applications is the failure of the applicant to give the model and year of the make of his car or truck in many cases it is absolutely essential to have this data before the comptroller is able to determine what series license to assign the car for example to describe a car simply as an overland touring would be quite insufficient for the reason that overland touring cars have been made in seven or eight different horse-power ratings the same is true in regard to many other makes of automobiles and especially so in the case of trucks the comptroller is very anxious to impress on all those sending in applications early that they indicate clearly whether the registration is for for registrations this year it may be of interest to the public to know that the estimate made early in the year that automobile registration for would likely reach has nearly been fulfilled already the registration numbers have to date gone to this includes some transfers chauffeurs and a few miscellaneous entries for duplicate tags the total registration on all classes will undoubtedly go beyond and after subtracting the registration of chauffeurs transfers and miscellaneous entries there will be left a net of registration of automobiles

kathleen long big strawberry crop this season the largest strawberry crop in several years is predicted for the plant city section this season reports from the growers show an increased acreage and prospects for a better crop than that of former seasons some doubt has been expressed as to whether the refrigerator boxes on hand will accommodate an unusually large crop a shortage of refrigerators will not impede the movement of the crop but will likely tend to lower the returns from berries as buyers do not usually give as much for berries shipped in crates as when shipped in refrigerator boxes it will be remembered that the refrigerator boxes ran short a day or two last season but this was due to negligence of the consignees and carriers in returning the empties promptly so far as can be ascertained no probable increased demand the boxes have been made to meet the scarcity and high prices of material and labor are the reasons assigned the estimated cost of manufacturing these boxes according to the estimates of some authorities has jumped from ten to twelve to eighteen dollars apiece with good service in returning empties however the more optimistic buyers think that the present

amendment loses out over the state the state of florida has turned down the amendment to vote twenty million dollars worth of bonds on the people for roads that would run anywhere and nowhere and that were not specified for any amounts and for any time or place from all reports over the state it seems that the large majority of the people turned down the amendment and turned it down so hard that it will not be thought of in the same breath for many years to come people want good roads but they do not want them in the shape that the amendment would give them meantime if some one gets up an amendment in terms to suit the tax payers it might be possible to carry it the amendment was defeated about five to one in almost every county in the state chuluota inn will open season on

over and a good time to forget it and get down to real business again and by real business we mean building of those new hotels and golf inks and all the new houses and the boat basin and the yacht club and that white way and a hundred other improvements we lose a lot of valuable time talking politics and yet its is no doubt for the good of the public and unless we take an active part in politics we will never elect good men to office and we believe this will apply in greater measure to the women than to the men and now that it is all over we still believe that the republican party means more wars and more battleships and greater armies in order that the big trusts and corporations and big business can sell their goods to the government at war prices this has always been their game and there is no reason why they should change time will tell armistice day is the next big thing on the calendar and this will be next week november th let us help the legion boys to make it one of the biggest days in the history of the city and to make it the biggest will take the united efforts of the boys and all of their friends it should be the day in history for to our mind it is that and then some when you think of what armistice day really meant to all us it begins to dawn on the mind that we cannot do too much that day to show our appreciation to the boys who sacrificed so much to make the world safe for the democrats republicans win at the time it looks like a landslide for harding for president and also the senate and house will be republican if the latter it is much better that harding is elected than cox for no man can do anything in the office of president when the house and senate are against him we just had such a condition and with it four years of back-biting and handicapping of the president until it broke his health and his spirit now with the republican president and the republican senate and house and the round robin senators to back him up it will be most interesting to watch the progress of the me too president that the republican houses have selected to pull their chestnuts out of the fire it will be more than interesting to see what harding does with the league of nations and it will be most interesting to see what he does with the irish question that he has promised to settle without the league of nations and for which he obtained the irish vote it will be most interesting to see what he does with germany now that he has obtained all the german votes in america by such promises and it will also be most interesting to see how he appeases the american mothers who were wanting to see peace and yet who did not think enough of the league of nations to vote for democracy we want to see how soon mannikin harding will start jumping on the bosses wire when they want to build up a bigger navy and army and spends millions for the same yes we are waiting to see many things that could not be forecast before the election and in this next four years it will be republicanism with a big and after it is all over they cannot lay anything to the democratic party it will be their own particular funeral and the people will be the ones to suffer as usual but here in the solid south we can stand the pressure all right and perhaps remain in the united states for another four years after four years of this bunch in power it is dead certain to go democratic in the woman vote is with us at last the present campaign has demonstrated one fact beyond the shadow of a doubt as the spell binders say and that is that the entrance of women into political life has been attended by none of the evils which were so freely predicted by the opponents of equal suffrage woman have not lowered they have not dragged their skirts in the slime of politics they are no worse for taking an intelligent interest in the government of the country in which they have always lived when the summing up is made there will stand to the credit of woman the example of intelligent conscientious citizenship which she has set for man everywhere the women have formed clubs and classes to fit themselves for their new duties they have studied the constitution of the nation and the laws which govern citizenship they have practiced voting in mock elections to familiarize themselves with the methods of voting they have listened to addresses from competent instructors and have attended political meetings of both parties to post themselves on the issues of the day they have done all this and much more without the sacrifice of a single womanly charm without neglecting a single home duty they have proved all the predictions of evil with the coming of equal suffrage to have no other foundation than the ignorance and prejudge of the false prophets who put them out where and when in all time have the male voters of the nation shown one-half the zeal and conscientious interest in voting that he women have shown in the brief time they have had to prepare themselves a man goes to the polls in a careless indifferent way urged by the dictates of party or the desire to help a friend to secure an office it is a mere incident of the day with many some do not go at all considering politics a dirty business with which they have no concern not so with women she considers it a solemn conscientious duty which she owes to protect the nation which has always protected her home and the education of her children she has endeavored to fit herself as beat she might for the performance of this sacred duty and she will cast her ballot in accordance with her convictions formed after a careful study of the issues of the campaign she will not be influenced by party traditions for she has no such traditions behind her she will be an

florida monday november number will not cut tax in next three years says sec houston outlines program to congress for carrying on steep income tax will be here to worry us for some time to come by the associated press washington nov the nation will face a continuance of the annual tax bill of four million dollars for at least three years if congress adopts recommendations drafted by treasury officials and which it was understood have been laid before secretary houston for approval mr houston it was said probably will include such recommendations in the form of an analysis of the governments financial condition in his forth-coming annual report to congress the analysis will show and accompanying recommendations will suggest it was said that a three-year program for tax revision is required in order to meet maturing government obligations and cover current federal expenses approximately eight billion dollars in victory notes war savings securities and treasury certificates of indebtedness will be due for payment within the next three years treasury figures show retention of the present aggregate level of taxes or maintenance of the annual revenue of the government at about four billion dollars then is held to be unavoidable on the face of the average expenditures estimated for the period recommendations to be made by mr houston it is understood will propose abolishment of the excess profit taxes in their entirety and the substitution of a graduated income tax of a substantially deeper cut than under present revenue laws it was believed the new income taxes would apply only to incomes above annually and that provision would be made for a graduated increase even on the additional tax as the amount of income grows larger the secretary is expected to advise congress that the strictest economy in federal appropriations is necessary if the program outlined on the basis of a four billion dollar tax bill is to be accomplished he has said that there was no way to estimate with any degree of accuracy what even the present laws would yield in revenue because of the rapidly changing conditions in business as a result of after-the-war transition and readjustment mr houstons view of this was said to be that tax receipts would be materially lower later in the present fiscal year which ends june and that therefore the government income under the present revenue laws could not be taken as a basis for calculating future receipts this attitude which is held also by practically all treasury officials having to do with tax collections forecasts a task of great difficulty for the farmers of the new revenue act the treasury will insist strongly on legislation which would produce four billions for the year but the ways and means of getting it will be left to congress except for the suggestions contained in the treasurys report in fact the tax law framers will be informed that there is no alternative to voting a revenue act that will produce the required amount whiskey ring in chicago brings indictments by the associated press chicago november indictments are expected to be returned against the result of the

have entire responsibility for the policies and administration of the government and cannot evade or excuse its failure to perform the promises it has made to the country under our political system it is always better to have one party control at washington than to have divided authority what the country imperatively needs now is subsidence of the passions and hatreds engendered by the war and partisan political appeals that have followed the country is sick of political standards and controversies it wants domestic as well as international peace and it wants restoration of that fine spirit of cooperation which made america invincible in war we face domestic and international problems of great gravity the only way to solve them is through co-operation the highest duty of the leaders of

is not even seriously wounded throughout our history overwhelming political reverses have been followed by extraordinary political recoveries so long as the democratic party is true to its mission of

democracy itself and above all for service of country it will not be difficult through proper leadership and organization to reinspire party enthusiasm to re store party unity to maintain party ideals and principles and to regain popular confidence to this task democratic leaders must devote themselves with patriotism and courage truckers organize to control labor situation the truckers of lee

prospects good crop and prices state to exceed boxes this year fine quality fruit orange season later than usual and more cool weather needed jacksonville nov there have been various estimates made on the size of the florida citrus fruit crop this year but so far as it is known only one estimate has been made as to quality all are agreed that the quality is good possibly the best ever placed on the market according to present indications one great difficulty in getting at an accurate yield estimate is the fact that the size of the new acreage coming into bearing each year is an almost unknown quantity most percentage estimates are based on the increase or decrease of fruit above or below that on the average in past years and but very little attention has been paid to ascertaining the volume of the crop on the new acreage early estimates on the citrus fruit crop on florida placed the probable yield at boxes these estimates were based on a percentage increase on yield over that of the previous year the increased acreage was not taken into consideration and at the close of the packing season in july it was learned from actual count that the various railroads of the state had shipped out of the state boxes of citrus fruit these figures do not take into consideration the amount of fruit consumed within the state nor the amount shipped out by express estimate on this years crop place the grapefruit crop at percent of last year and the orange crop at to percent of last year practically all estimates agree on the grapefruit crop being less than last season on the same acreage and the orange crop being larger than last year on the same acreage the new acreage coming into bearing seems not to have been considered in a percentage way in its september estimate the

a circus band is different from any other did you ever notice that did you ever notice how you can tell a circus band from any other collection of musical instruments the minute you hear it and yet most probably youve never known the reason therefore allow to be introduced one prof john phillips director of the combined bands of the sparks circus which is to exhibit in sanford on tuesday nov rd also allow to be introduced prof phillips explanation of why a circus band is different the whole thing lies in one instrument prof phillips said the other day that one instrument is the slide trombone without the slide trombone the circus band would not exist it carries the whole weight of the band and its sliding notes and quick changes are what gives the music of a circus band its originality just listen closely to the bands of the circus when we come to sanford and youll find that we have more slide trombones than three or four bands usually have but we dont call them slide trombones they are slip horns and so it is that soon there will be the blaring music of the slip horns for the circus is not far away and they will be played not only in the parade but in the

winter visitors they come down here to see flowers and fruits and we should have then to show when all the new building that is contemplated in sanford next year is started this city will look like a real city and every citizen should stand back of his city and help it to move that old grouchy feeling that disapproves of all new movements and wants to knock instead of to boost should be thrown off

stick to the pulpit or look for another job that question was presented to the judge of an ohio court in a divorce proceeding in which extreme cruelty in failing to provide was charged by the wife the court granted the decree holding that an able bodied man who accepted a salary of that amount was guilty of cruelty to his family the decision was probably justified by the special facts of the case but how about the principle involved what shall be done with the college professor who earns less than the hod carrier shall the newspaper man separated from his family because he can not earn as much as the bricklayer gets how shall we dispose of the army of school teachers who draw less pay than common laborers the question will require more than one judicial decision before it is finally settled

that rest where do you obtain that spirit of repose which stimulates and rejuvenates that entire human fabric there are many ways and places but one is more beneficial than all others combined that is your weekly visit to the church on sunday morning or evening or both even if you hear not one word the minister says the simple knowledge that you are in the sanctuary of the lord casts a feeling of calmness solemnity and repose over you which is good for the mind the body and the soul a pumpkin with a lantern the columbia enquirer-sun quotes from a northern paper comments on the recrudescence of the ku klux klan and says it is to be regretted of course that such movements and organizations occasionally bob up to give the south a little more unfavorable publicity and call forth ill-considered criticism of this section as a whole which is all the more reason why the enquirer-sun for one takes this occasion to explode the idea that this particular klan is in any way representative of southern sentiment or that it has any mission whatsoever to perform other than to furnish perhaps a new order for jiners and a new job for organizers in short our ku klux klan is merely a sort of halloween affair a pumpkin with a lantern in it as its chief wizards and potentates and such like insist on explaining obviously out of respect for law and public sentiment for they know full well that the south will not tolerate any organization that attempts to set aside or override the law of the land for they know full well that in these times and in this age the south no more that the north will tolerate any organization that essays to set aside or over-ride the law of the land undoubtedly reports of the ku klux klan added to hardings majority but he would have been overwhelming elected without its help it is probable that it caused the election of a few republican senators and representatives who would otherwise have been defeated but that only gave the republicans such an overwhelming majority in congress that they will be more apt to make fools of themselves and give the democrats a chance to defeat them two years hence it is also true that it revived the race issue which had been settled satisfactorily to the whole people of the south and made not improbable the passage of a force bill by the next congress which will be overwhelmingly republican it created a prejudice of the north against the south which will retard the development of the southern states it also fanned the embers of antagonism between whites and blacks to the detriment of both races it is a pity that men who do conspicuous things do not use their heads before doing them we refer to the ku klux klan as it appeared in the north the statement of the leader of it that it stood for law and order that it was as the enquirer-sun so aptly put it merely a pumpkin with a lantern in it shows that it was merely foolishness borrowing the wrong name for the old ku klux klan was not foolishness it was terribly in earnest and was deadly in its operations it killed for the salvation of the south and it saved the south in that way when there was no other way to do it when it had accomplished its purposes it disbanded in a day on the order of its chief officer no army that ever fought was more thoroughly disciplined it fought against law and order for the upbuilding of a better order it went through violence to peace and it did what it did only because there was no other way by which the purposes could be accomplished but it caused a great deal of disorder while it lasted by furnishing an object of suspicion if smith hated jones badly enough to assassinate him he assassinated him and put up signs turning suspicion on the ku klux klan the klan was not responsible for half the violence that was attributed to it it was not criminal but it tempted to crime by furnishing an object of suspicion now the white people of the south are in charge of their state governments and have in their hands all the machinery of the law this should make them use it with justice for the famed chivalry of the south is a myth if it uses its power to oppress the weak times-union post cards
